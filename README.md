# Challenge 1 - Horiseon Webpage

## Description

This project consisted of HTML and CSS starter code for the Horiseon Social Solution Services website. The purpose of this project was to edit this starter code so it could meet accessibility standards. 

This was achieved by: 
 - Adding correct semantic HTML elements
 - Logically structuring both the HTML and CSS code
 - Adding accessible alt attributes to the icon and image elements
 - Ordering the heading attributes in sequential order
 - Creating a concise, descriptive title

The website is visually the same and fully operational. The deployed website can be viewed through this link - https://bondt1.github.io/Challenge-1/
